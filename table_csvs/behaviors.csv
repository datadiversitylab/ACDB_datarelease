Alcatraz Western gulls foraging preference,"foraging specialization of fish or human refuse ""The diets of individual pairs showed considerable variation in proportion of these two primary food sources, with pair diets ranging from those consisting almost entirely of fish to those consisting entirely of human refuse (Fig. 6). The single most common diet was represented by 23 pairs (21%) that were never observed to take fish during their breeding life-spans. Most of these pairs bred for only one season and failed to fledge any offspring; only one of these pairs bred for as many as three seasons, and only two fledged as many as two chicks over their breeding life-spans...Diets of male, but not female, recruits were correlated with diets of their parents…we examine the diets of banded offspring produced on our study colony that returned to breed within the colony. All 11 banded chicks in this category were male, and established breeding territories that were within 50 m of their natal territories…Female gulls are less philopatric than males, as was expected; in general, male birds show much stronger natal philopatry than do females (Greenwood 1980, Greenwood and Harvey 1982). In contrast to male recruits, banded female offspring during their first year of breeding showed no dietary relationship to their parents...In gulls, the dominant offspring within a brood is known to defend one or both of its parents against its siblings as a ""feeding territory"" away from the natal colony (Drury and Smith 1968). The dominant offspring is typically the oldest and largest male within a brood, or the sole surviving male (Briggs 1977; R. Pierotti, unpublished data)….This suggests that the large numbers of birds that feed largely or primarily on human refuse (scavengers) are probably excluded siblings (females and smaller males), which are prevented by their dominant sibling from accompanying their parent(s) during foraging, and which congregate around predictable sources of lower quality food, such as refuse dumps, picnic areas, or intertidal zones (e.g., Niebuhr 1983, Sibly and McLeery 1983, Irons et al. 1986).
